This practise demonstrates how to perform basic database operations in Spring Boot using Spring JDBC with an H2 in-memory database. It covers the setup of JdbcTemplate and DataSource, as well as using SQL scripts for schema creation and data insertion.

Features

Spring Boot Integration: Simplifies application setup and configuration.

Spring JDBC: Performs CRUD operations using JdbcTemplate.

H2 In-Memory Database: Lightweight, fast, and ideal for development/testing.

Database Initialization:

schema.sql – Defines the database tables.

data.sql – Preloads sample data.

Layered Architecture: Uses Controller, Service, and Repository layers.
